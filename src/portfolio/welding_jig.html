<h1 id="welding-jig">Welding Jig</h1>
<p><em>Designed and built a welding jig for the UCI Frame Building
club</em></p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>During my junior year at UCI, my friend and I started up a small
frame building club, following our love for riding bicycles. We had
never fabricated our own frames before, or done any serious welding for
that matter. As we were starting from ground zero, our first project was
to design and manufacture a welding jig.</p>
<h3 id="revision-1">Revision 1</h3>
<p>In order to weld a bicycle frame together it is necessary to fixture
the tubes in a consistent and calculated fashion. Commercially available
welding jigs were outside of our clubs budget so designing our own was
the only option. A good welding jig is easy to set and relatively
accurate (compromising on dimensional accuracy was a major theme
throughout the design process). Our first iteration was over engineered,
and it took us longer than I would care to admit for us to realize
that.</p>

<p><strong>rev1</strong> would require a lot of machining, some of which
was probably overly difficult and complicated. But we were determined to
push forward since we desperately needed a welding jig. The school year
was coming to an end and we wanted something to show for our first year
as a club. Machining had begun on the arms holding the head-tube and
seat-tube in place. Fortunately, we didnâ€™t get much more done and had to
hang the project over summer, giving us some time to become less
attached to this revision.</p>
<h3 id="revision-2">Revision 2</h3>
<p>When we looked at it again in fall we did a sort of informal design
review of <strong>rev1</strong> and came up with a much more simplified
design. Since we already had some of the parts machined we made sure to
preserve these in our next revision. By comparing both drawings it
should be clear how much simpler the manufacturing would be. This was
thanks to taking advantage of more OTS parts used for 8020
extrusions.</p>

<p>This was our last revision that eventually got manufactured. Using a
mix of tools in our garage and the machine shop on campus we were able
to make quick work of it. We were also pretty excited once it was
finished; hence the fancy pictures.</p>

<p><em>Classification of activities using IMU data collected from a
wristwatch and mobile phone.</em></p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>This project took place during my junior year at the University of
California - Irvine and was meant to simulate a real world machine
learning task from start to finish. The dataset was provided by the
universities public machine learning repository and required significant
manipulation before it was in workable condition. The aim of the project
was to use accelerometer and gyroscopic data from a users wristwatch and
mobile phone to estimate their current activity. Data from both devices
was sampled at a rate of 20Hz. The dataset included recordings from 51
different test subjects each conducting 18 different activities for
three minutes a piece. Different classical machine learning models were
evaluated including : k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Support
Vector Machines and Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.</p>
<p>Below are some illustrations of how the data is distributed for
different activities and users. Both plots only show data for the x-axis
acceleration of the users mobile phone, which is only one of twelve
different datapoints collected at each instance in time. Tall peaks in
both plots indicate a resting state at a particular orientation. When
the distribution is spread thin it indicates the user was moving across
these states of acceleration throughout the activity. It is not clear
from this data alone how the algorithm would separate each activity but
it should help to give a better understanding of what we are dealing
with.</p>

<p>Below we see data for one activity from twenty different users.
Standing still is sure to give us a concentrated set of acceleration
data however each user has their phone oriented relative to their body
in different ways. From this it should be clear that the exact mobile
phone orientation will be less significant than the relative changes in
acceleration when it comes to predicting various activities.</p>

<h3 id="data-pre-processing">Data Pre-Processing</h3>
<p>With gigabytes of data, spread across many different files and
folders, this stage of the project was easily the most laborious.
Eventually everything was packed neatly into one single data structure,
using a windowing method that I try to illustrate in the below graphic.
Looking at windows of time allows for richer insights into the what the
user is doing and was a necessary feature considering the models I used
for training were time-agnostic.</p>

<p>Features were then extracted from each window, these included the
mean value, variance, most prominent frequency, integral and more. I
include a neat example of when the most prominent frequency, calculated
by performing a fourier transform, might be of use. In this example, it
is clear that the back and forth motion of the users arm while brushing
their teeth is being registered by the watches accelerometer.</p>

<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>The machine learning algorithms covered throughout the course are
what is considered to be the traditional set of algorithms, of which I
am excluding the now very popular network architectures (so LSTM’s are
out). The models I <em>did</em> use include; quadratic discriminant
analysis (QDA), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), support vector machines (SVM)
and random forests (RF). I will not explain how each of these work but
if you want more context you are free to look at the full report
attached at the end.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Again, I will abbreviate my analysis of the results here and instead
point you towards the full paper. I will however share this table;</p>

<p>Accuracy here means that the model correctly predicted the activity
taking place during a window of recorded time. I also discovered, rather
intuitively, that discerning between similar activities, such as the
eating of different types of food, was much harder than predicting
whether the user was either writing or clapping.</p>

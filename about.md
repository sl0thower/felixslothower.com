# About me...

I have never been good at writing about myself but if I had to give it a shot it would probably start with explaining that I really enjoy making things. I have been like this since as early as I can remember. Perhaps from reading through some of my portfolio this much is already clear. So I guess I could also mention that I spend a lot of time on a bicycle; mountain-biking, gravel-biking, commute-biking and fixing bikes. Sometimes, I'll also spend my free time in the wilderness, intentionally getting lost, and then hopefully finding my way again! Finally I will share a rather over-zealous photo of myself brazing a lugged bicycle frame, which admittedly I never saw through to the end (you'll have to visit [Tony's](https://tonydrabeck.com/) website for the final product).

Besides the projects I cover in this portfolio, some of my more recreational endeavors include brewing beer, building a bedside table in oak and designing a concrete candle holder---all of which I try to neatly present in the following image.

### As for my education;

I am currently wrapping up my Master's in Machine Learning and Control at Lund's Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan (LTH). Before this I was a student at the University of California - Irvine studying Mechanical Engineering. The two fields of study might sound similar---machines and mechanical things---but to the unawares, this is not exactly the case. While there are some examples such as reinforcement learning in robotics, and perhaps topology optimization for niche manufacturing applications, generally the two domains don't overlap. 

My education in both domains were nonetheless a net-positive. That is to say, I learned something from both and I see this as a good thing!

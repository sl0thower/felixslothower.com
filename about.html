<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I have never been good at writing about myself but if I had to give
it a shot it would probably start with explaining that I really enjoy
making things. I have been like this since as early as I can remember.
Perhaps from reading through some of my portfolio this much is already
clear. So I guess I could also mention that I spend a lot of time on a
bicycle; mountain-biking, gravel-biking, commute-biking and fixing
bikes. Sometimes I’ll also spend my free time in the wilderness,
intentionally getting lost, and then hopefully finding my way again!
Finally I will share a rather over-zealous photo of myself brazing a
lugged bicycle frame, which admittedly I never saw through to the end
(you’ll have to visit <a href="https://tonydrabeck.com/">Tony’s</a>
website for the final product).</p>

<p>Besides the projects I cover in this portfolio, some of my more
recreational endeavors include brewing beer, building a bedside table in
oak and designing a concrete candle holder—all of which I try to neatly
present in the following image.</p>

<h3 id="as-for-my-education">As for my education</h3>
<p>I am currently wrapping up my Master’s in Machine Learning and
Control at Lund’s Tekniska Högskolan (LTH). Before this I was a student
at the University of California - Irvine studying Mechanical
Engineering. The two fields of study might sound similar—machines and
mechanical things—but to the unawares, this is not exactly the case.
While there are some examples such as reinforcement learning in
robotics, and perhaps topology optimization for niche manufacturing
applications, generally the two domains don’t overlap.</p>
<p>My education in both domains were nonetheless a net-positive. That is
to say, I learned something from both and I see this as a good
thing!</p>

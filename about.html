</p>
<p>I have a strong passion for science and technology, and have always
been curious to learn more about the natural world. This passion has led
to many professional and recreational endeavours as you might have
already seen in my portfolio. But besides those projects, I have also
taken up brewing beer, building a bedside table in oak and designing a
concrete candle holder—all of which I try to neatly present in the photo
below.</p>

<p>While I do enjoy learning about the underlying science of
fermentation, and learning that cement is caustic (lol); those last few
projects can also be explained by my love for working with my hands.</p>
<p>I am currently wrapping up my Master’s in Machine Learning and
Control at Lund’s Tekniska Högskolan (LTH). Before this I was a student
at the University of California - Irvine studying Mechanical
Engineering. The two fields of study might sound similar—machines and
mechanical things—but to the unawares, this is not exactly the case.
While there are some examples such as reinforcement learning in
robotics, and perhaps topology optimization for niche manufacturing
applications, generally the two domains don’t overlap.</p>

A small cog in a big machine. However, I am yet to understand what this small cog does exactly. It is indeed small. It is also rather silly. And it isn't very old (judging by it's clean teeth). But how the small cog drives the big machine and how this small cog might one day grow to be a big cog is very unclear. The small cog is me.

This website is a work in progress. Still not sure what I want out of this. But so far I am enjoying editing the css and the various pages. Sometimes the static'ness of eleventy bothers me. I want to have some client side 3d animations for example and I'm having a hard time navigating the necessary steps to make that work.

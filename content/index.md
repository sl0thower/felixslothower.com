Welcome to my portfolio website! A place for sharing some of the bigger projects I have worked on as well as some more info about myself. 

I now hold a MSc. in Machine Learning, Systems and Control at Lund Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan and a BSc. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California - Irvine. My technical skills span these two fields and I also have lots of experience working with tools and building things from scratch; bikes, tables, lights and [this website](../../portfolio/this_website/index.html), to name a few. 

[^none]:I took this picture just outside of Tromso, Norway in the winter months. The sun doesn't make it above the fjords during this time and makes for some really nice lighting [^none].

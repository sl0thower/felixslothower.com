Trying to learn danish. My name is felix slothower and I have spent far too much time just aligning the elements on this page.

I'm too young to know what the internet used to be. Times Person of the Year in 2006 was **you**. It was a picture of a computer and the screen had a mirror finish so that you saw a reflection of yourself on the magazine cover. I wasn't reading Times magazine back then but I learned about it through one of geohot's livestreams.

Maybe my development of this website is trying to connect with whatever the internet was like way back then. Kinda like this guys [website](http://www.verostko.com/menu.html) I recently found.

/images and /art don't link to anything yet and that is ok.

You can find my blog posts, if any, at this <a href="/blog/index.html">link</a>

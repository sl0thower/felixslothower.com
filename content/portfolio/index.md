{% image "./norway.jpg", "nice picture from norway" %}

Welcome to my portfolio website! A place for sharing some of the bigger projects I have worked on as well as some more info about myself. 

I now hold a MSc. in Machine Learning, Systems and Control from Lunds Tekniska Högskolan and a BSc. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California - Irvine. My technical skills span these two fields and I also have lots of experience working with tools and building things from scratch; bikes, tables, lighting and [this website](../../portfolio/this_website/index.html), to name a few. 

> I took this picture just outside of Tromsø, Norway in November. The sun doesn't make it above the fjords during this time and makes for some nice lighting.

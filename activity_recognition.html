<p><em>Classification of activities from IMU data in
wristwatch.</em></p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>My first course in Machine Learning, taken during my undergrad at the
University of California - Irvine, concluded with a project in activity
recognition. More specifically, we were tasked with identifying a range
of activities based solely on acceleration and gyroscopic effect
recorded in a wristwatch at a frequency of 20Hz. The dataset comes from
an organized experiment where nearly 51 test subjects conducted a
variety of activities in short bursts of a couple minutes. The
activities ranged from walking and running to eating and clapping.
Different classical machine learning models were evaluated including :
k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Linear
and Quadtratic Discriminant Analysis.</p>

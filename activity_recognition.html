<p><em>Classification of activities using IMU data collected from a
wristwatch and mobile phone.</em></p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>This project took place during my junior year at the University of
California - Irvine and was meant to simulate a real world machine
learning task from start to finish. The dataset was provided by the
universities public machine learning repository and required significant
manipulation before it was in workable condition. The aim of the project
was to use accelerometer and gyroscopic data from a users wristwatch and
mobile phone to estimate their current activity. Data from both devices
was sampled at a rate of 20Hz. The dataset included recordings from 51
different test subjects each conducting 18 different activities for
three minutes a piece. Different classical machine learning models were
evaluated including : k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Support
Vector Machines and Linear and Quadtratic Discriminant Analysis.</p>
<p>Below are some illustrations of how the data is distributed for
different activities and users. Both plots only show data for the x-axis
acceleration of the users mobile phone, which is only one of twelve
different datapoints collected at each instance in time. Tall peaks in
both plots indicate a resting state at a partiular orientation. When the
distribution is spread thin it indicates the user was moving across
these states of acceleration throughout the acitvity. It is not clear
from this data alone how the algorithm would seperate each activity but
it should help to give a better understanding of what we are dealing
with.</p>

<p>Below we see data for one activity from twenty different users.
Standing still is sure to give us a concentrated set of acceleration
data however each user has their phone oriented relative to their body
in different ways. From this it should be clear that mobile phone
orientation will not be very informative when it comes to predicting
specific activities.</p>

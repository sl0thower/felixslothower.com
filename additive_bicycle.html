<p><em>Design of an additively manufactured and weldless mountain
bike.</em></p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>As my senior project at UCI, me and two other friends tried to
imagine what the future of high performance mountain-biking might look
like. New technologies such as additive manufacturing in metal and
ultra-high bond adhesives led us to rethink the way bicycles are
manufactured. Using these technologies we believed a high performance,
carbon and titanium mountain bike, could be custom fit to each customer
and assembled without the need for laborious welding operations.</p>
<p>This was the driving mission behind our project, but as some might
already suspect, such a future is many years out as the cost of additive
manufacturing still needs to come down for this to be a viable product.
This idea is not novel. There are multiple other companies and
individuals doing something similar; Atherton Bikes, Bastion Cycles, a
guy named Ralf Holleis who’s bike he called the Moorhuhn 129 (his bike
is the crown jewel imo but never went into production).</p>
<h3 id="d-modeling">3D Modeling</h3>
<p>The bicycle is primarily made up of carbon tubes and 3D printed lugs.
The lugs were modeled in CAD and allow for updates in the underlying
geometry to allow for a custom spec for each customer. I pushed myself
to use the more advanced surfacing techniques available in Solidworks so
that I could achieve more natural and smooth radiuses. As Solidworks is
not the best surfacing tool, the modeling of the lugs came with several
setbacks and reworks. But in the end I was able to model the headtube
lug, bottom bracket lug and seattube lug.</p>

<h3 id="simulations">Simulations</h3>
<p>Two different simulation tools were used; nTopology and Abacus.
Screenshots from both tools are shown respectively. nTopology was used
to simulate the rider load at the bottom bracket and analyze the
strength of our design. Abacus was used to model the carbon tube layups
and decide on a suitable strength for our application. We were not able
to do a full assembly simulation due to limited computer resources so
discrete simulations were carried out instead.</p>

<h3 id="production">Production</h3>
<p>With the school year coming to a close we had just enough time to
launch two prints, the first being only a small section of the seattube
lug as seen in the first image. Print management and instructions were
handled with Autodesk Netfabb. We were also able to print the full
bottom bracket lug.</p>
<p>I feel like it’s only fair to mention that due to poor design
oversight (and not conducting a rigorous design review!) some of the
dimensions were improperly spec’d.  It came as a heavy blow to the
team’s moral but there was reason to point fingers, everyone held the
responsibility to check and then re-check all the dimensions. Looking
back on this I am still proud of what we were able to accomplish, and
while it may have it’s flaws, the bottom bracket sits proudly on my
shelf, like a trophy.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to give credit to the other members of the team. Some
solid project partners and happy to still call them friends today.</p>

# Activity Recognition

*Classification of activities from IMU data in a wristwatch and mobile phone.*

### Background
My first course in Machine Learning, taken during my undergrad at the University of California - Irvine, concluded with a project in activity recognition. More specifically, we were tasked with identifying a range of activities based solely on acceleration and gyroscopic effect recorded in a wristwatch at a frequency of 20Hz. The dataset comes from an organized experiment where nearly 51 test subjects conducted a variety of activities in short bursts of a couple minutes. The activities ranged from walking and running to eating and clapping. Different classical machine learning models were evaluated including : k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Linear and Quadtratic Discriminant Analysis.
